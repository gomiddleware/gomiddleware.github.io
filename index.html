      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/gomiddleware">Go Middleware</a> is a collection of standard HTTP middleware
        packages for Go that you can use individually in your projects. It has two aims in life:
      </p>
      <h3>Minimal Dependencies</h3>
      <p>
        Most middlewares have shallow or no dependencies apart from the standard library. We don't want to bring in the
        entire jungle for any middleware you need.
      </p>
      <h3>Use of the Standard Library's `context` Package..</h3>
      <p>
        Rather than having to rely on something else such as Gorilla's `context` package, we prefer to use what we have
        already been given. It also means we don't have to install an extra library too.
      </p>

      <h2>

        All Middleware
      </h2>
      <p>
         By relying on minimal dependencies, the standard library and the standard `context` package, you can be sure
         that if you vendor in any middleware here it will be both as minimal and as compatible as can be. This is just
         a start and many more will become available over time.
      </p>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/gomiddleware/slash">slash</a> (<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/gomiddleware/slash">godoc</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You may notice some overlap in some middlewares and that's because we favour keeping the simple ones simple and
        adding a new package for more complicated uses. This doesn't increase too much duplication and since Go is rock
        solid for both running and compiling (through the Go v1 compatibility promise) you can be sure that each
        package is also pretty stable and well-tested.
      </p>
